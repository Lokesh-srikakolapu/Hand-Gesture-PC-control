# Hand-Gesture-PC-control

The project's aim is to develop a hand gesture recognition system that uses the 
mediapipe and OpenCV libraries in Python to track hand motions and identify 
distinct hand gestures. The technology recognises particular hand movements 
and may be used to control different computer programmes and services.
